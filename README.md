# ExSHalos

This is a python package that implements [ExSHalos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06630) and many other utilities for cosmological analysis:
- Measurement of the power/bi/tri-spectra for any number of tracers in a box;
- Population of halos with galaxies using a HOD and split of galaxies for the creation of multi-tracer catalogues;
- Creation of density grid and catalogue of particles created by LPT;
- Computation of shifted Lagrangian operators;
- Computation of EFTofLSS, for multi-tracers, using [CLASS-PT](https://github.com/Michalychforever/CLASS-PT);
- Computation of simple theoretical quantities (e.g. growth function, growth rate, mass function, ...).

This library follows the functional programming paradigm! There are no classes, random operators nor custom types.

## Installation 

### On your machine (not recommended)

To install [pyExSHalos](https://github.com/Voivodic/ExSHalos) a few libraries are required:

#### C requirements:
- [FFTW3](https://www.fftw.org/) (required for installation)
- [GSL/CBLAS](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (required for installation)
- [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) (required for installation)

#### Python requirements:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) (required for installation and running)
- [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/) (required for installation)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (required for building)
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/) (required for running)

After all libraries were installed, you just need to
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Voivodic/ExSHalos.git
cd ExSHalos
pip install .
```

### On a container/ephemeral shell

You have three main options to install ExSHalos. For the case you do not want to handle the dependencies manually and want an isolated working space:

#### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

To create a Docker image you only need to
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Voivodic/ExSHalos.git
cd ExSHalos
docker build -t your_image_name -f install/
```

Then, to create a Docker container and enter into its shell
```bash
docker run -it --name your_container_name your_image_name
```

#### [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)

An open source alternative to Docker (usually used in scientific clusters) is Apptainer. You can create similar images doing:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Voivodic/ExSHalos.git
cd ExSHalos
apptainer build your_image_name.sif install/exshalos.def
```

Then, to enter in an isolated shell
```bash
apptainer shell your_image_name.sif
```

#### [Nix](https://nixos.org/)

Last but not least, you can also create an ephemeral shell using Nix with flakes. For this, you only need to run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Voivodic/ExSHalos.git
cd ExSHalos
nix develop install/
```

## Quick start

Using the python interface for ExSHalos is as simple as:

```python
    import numpy as np
    import pyexshalos as exh
    import pylab as pl

    # Load a linear matter power spectrum
    k, Pk = np.loadtxt("matter_power_spectrum.dat", unpack = True)

    # Create the halo catalogue using exshalos
    halos = exh.mock.Generate_Halos_Box_from_Pk(k, Pk, nd = 256, Lc = 4.0, Om0 = 0.31)

    # Measure the power spectrum
    grid = exh.simulation.Compute_Density_Grid(halos["posh"], nd = 256, L = 1024.0)
    Ph = exh.simulation.Compute_Power_Spectrum(grid, L = 1024.0)

    # Plot the power spectrum
    pl.errorbar(Ph["k"], Ph["Pk"], yerr = Ph["Pk"]/np.sqrt(Ph["Nk"]), lw = 3)

    pl.xscale("log")
    pl.yscale("log")
    pl.xlabel("k [$h/$Mpc]", fontsize=15)
    pl.ylabel("P(k)  [Mpc/$h/$]$^{3}$", fontsize=15)

    pl.savefig("Ph_example.pdf")
```
